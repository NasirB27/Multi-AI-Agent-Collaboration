# AI Agents Framework Implementations

This repository contains reference implementations of AI agents using two popular frameworks: AutoGen and Semantic Kernel. These implementations demonstrate basic agent patterns that can be extended for more complex use cases.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+ (for AutoGen)
- .NET 7.0+ (for Semantic Kernel)
- Azure OpenAI Service API access

### Installation

#### AutoGen
```bash
pip install pyautogen
```

#### Semantic Kernel
```bash
dotnet add package Microsoft.SemanticKernel
```

## üìã Code Samples

### 1. AutoGen Basic Agent

The AutoGen implementation demonstrates how to create a conversational agent system with:
- An assistant agent that processes and solves tasks
- A user proxy agent that represents the human user
- Proper conversation flow control

Key features:
- Robust error handling
- Environment validation
- Configurable parameters
- Auto-reply limits to prevent infinite loops

Example usage:
```python
# Define your task
task = "Explain binary search and provide Python code"

# Run the agent conversation
run_agent_conversation(task)
```

### 2. Semantic Kernel Basic Agent

The Semantic Kernel implementation shows how to:
- Create a kernel with Azure OpenAI integration
- Define custom functions from prompts
- Use a stepwise planner for complex reasoning
- Process results with proper error handling

Key features:
- Azure OpenAI integration
- Function registration
- Planning capability
- Logging and monitoring

Example usage:
```csharp
// Define your task
var task = "Research quantum computing and explain its impact on cryptography";

// Execute the plan
var result = await planner.ExecuteAsync(kernel, task);
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Implemented Enhancements

Both implementations include several enhancements over basic examples:

### Error Handling & Validation
- Comprehensive try/catch blocks
- Environment variable validation
- Input parameter validation
- Meaningful error messages

### Configuration & Performance
- Structured configuration with sensible defaults
- Resource limits to prevent runaway processes
- Timeout controls
- Token usage optimization

### Code Quality
- Clear documentation and comments
- Modular design for extensibility
- Consistent naming conventions
- Separation of concerns

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

   - Inter-agent communication protocols
   - Role-based task distribution

2. **Memory Integration**
   - Persistent context across sessions
   - Vector storage for semantic retrieval
   - Prioritized memory management

3. **Tool Integration**
   - Web search capabilities
   - API connectors
   - Document processing
   - Code execution environments

### Semantic Kernel

1. **Vector Database Integration**
   - Semantic memory with Azure AI Search
   - Embedding generation and storage
   - Similarity search capabilities

2. **Plugins System**
   - Pluggable architecture for extensions
   - Custom tool integration
   - Domain-specific skill libraries

3. **Knowledge Integration**
   - Knowledge graph connections
   - Structured data reasoning
   - Ontology-aware planning

## üß™ Best Practices

For production deployments, consider implementing:

- **Comprehensive Testing**
  - Unit tests for each component
  - Integration tests for end-to-end flows
  - Prompt regression testing

- **CI/CD Pipeline**
  - Automated build and test
  - Deployment automation
  - Version control integration

- **Documentation**
  - API documentation
  - Usage examples
  - Architecture diagrams

- **Security**
  - Proper API key management
  - Input validation and sanitization
  - Rate limiting
  - Content filtering

## üîí Environment Setup

Both implementations require setting environment variables:

### AutoGen
```
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
AZURE_OPENAI_API_BASE=your-endpoint
```

### Semantic Kernel
```
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=your-endpoint
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=your-deployment
```
